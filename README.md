# Pyxis Safe

Pyxis Safe is a multi-signature platform for Cosmos-based blockchains.

If you are familiar with [Safe (Previously Gnosis Safe)](https://safe.global/) for Ethereum, we tried to reuse as much as possible the UX of the Gnosis web-app as it is already clean and straightforward to use. However, the architecture design and workflow of Pyxis Safe is totally independent from Gnosis. Pyxis Safe works only with Cosmos-based blockchains.

## How to use
