# Aura Safe

Aura-Safe is a multi-signature platform for Cosmos-based blockchain.

If you are familliar with [Gnosis-safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) for Ethereum, we try to reuse as much as possible the UX of the gnosis web app as it is really clean and straightforward to use. However, the architecture design and workflow of Aura Safe is totally independent from Gnosis. Aura Safe works only with Cosmos-based blockchains.

## How to use
Aura-Safe is still in development, you can check out the latest deployed Dev version in the Deployed environment section.
